      "summary": "Showdown version 1.0.0 was released almost 3 years ago, back in May 2015. Since then, it has seen a lot of improvements, with a boost to performance and a significant number of features now included in the core of the library. However, do to backwards compatibility constrains, we are still supporting a lot of legacy features, that prevent us from moving the software forward.\n\nWith that in mind, **it is time to start thinking about Showdown version 2.0.** For the next major release of Showdown we have planned a range of **significant changes and additions**."
